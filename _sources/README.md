# Welcome to the UC Berkeley Data Science Curriculum Guide!

## The Guide has Moved!

This guide is now located at [ds-modules.github.io/curriculum-guide](https://ds-modules.github.io/curriculum-guide).

### What is this guide and who is it for?

The information in the guide is primarily intended for instructors who either currently are or will be teaching a course in the UC Berkeley Data Science Education Program: either a connector course, a data-enabled course, or a course featuring a data science module. However, anyone else who wants to learn more about the program, the courses, and the technology is encouraged to look through the guide.
