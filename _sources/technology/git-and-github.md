# Git and GitHub

## What are Git and GitHub?

Git is a version control software that tracks changes in files and allows multiple users to work on the same files in parallel smoothly. Git is often used in conjunction with GitHub, a website that hosts code and files \(it is the site you are currently visiting\). A repository \(aka repo\) on GitHub holds the files for a specific project. GitHubâ€™s web interface also displays the information that Git tracks, such as which users are working on a file and what changes have been made to the file.

## Why should I store materials on GitHub?

Storing materials on the Data 8 GitHub allows you to use nbgitpuller Links for assignment distribution. It's also allows you to use the version control features that Git provides. In addition, it provides a central public location for connector course materials across semesters.

## Is my GitHub repository private?

No. Don't store answer keys and other private materials on the GitHub repo.

## Getting Access

Each connector course has its own repo on the \[Data 8 GitHub organization\]\([https://github.com/data-8\](https://github.com/data-8%29\). This repo is a place where you can store course materials such as Jupyter notebooks. Instructors and CAs should have full access to their connector's repo.
