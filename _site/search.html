At this early stage, it’s common to be unsure what the module will look like or to have questions about how much can reasonable accomplished during it. The next three sections will go over how a module gets made and provide tips for creating your own. Important Considerations When thinking about adding a module to your course, there are four important questions to consider. What do you want students to take away from the module? This might include a particular coding or...",

            "Fixing JupyterHub Errors You may run into different types of errors when you are using the JupyterHub. One common error is a Jupyter notebook becoming unresponsive. Another type of error is a user not being able to access some part of their JupyterHub account. We have outlined two methods below that you should try for each error type. For errors related to execution of code, such as the notebook not running properly, you should try restarting the kernel. For errors related to access, you should try restarting the server. If these methods do not solve the issue you are facing,...",

Keep in mind, regardless of the size of your dataset, each account on DataHub is provided with ~1GB RAM, so this will limit the amount of data that you can read in at any time. If you want to temporarily increase this limit on RAM, please contact us on Piazza.

In order to make the courses accessible to students of all majors, we wanted to use technology that was simple but powerful. We did not want students to deal with the frustrations of setting up and maintaining a development environment, which are often experienced in introductory computing courses.

This notebook is typically given out as the first assignment, so that students can acclimate themselves to working with Python in Jupyter before they get to the nitty-gritty of data science work.
